    "Definition And Explanation\n",
    "In coding, classes and variables are two very important things in your coding journey. A class is very similar to a blueprint; it defines what an object should do and how it should do it. For example, if you were to create a class named “Car”, that class isn’t just a car. It can have details like the color of the car, what brand the car is, the top speed of the car, and many more ideas. On the other hand, we have variables. These are used to store information. These can be numbers, words, or even objects created from classes. You can think of variables as of a container that holds a piece of data. When you combine these two, they both make your code more organized and easier to understand. Now, although they sound similar, they are actually different. A variable is just a single container that holds one piece of data you want. A class, on the other hand, is much bigger, as I said before, it’s just like a blueprint that can contain lots of variables and functions, but this time they are all grouped together. Instead of just holding one value like a variable, a class can describe a whole thing with multiple different variables. What this does is it makes your code a lot more organized, simple, convenient, and user-friendly.\n",
